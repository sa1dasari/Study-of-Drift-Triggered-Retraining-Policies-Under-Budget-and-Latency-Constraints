# Three types of concept drift that are being simulated

1. **Sudden/Abrupt Drift**: The data distribution changes abruptly at a specific point in time. 
2. **Gradual Drift**: The data distribution changes gradually over time/window. 
3. **Recurring Drift**: The data distribution changes in a cyclical/periodic manner, where previously seen distributions may reoccur after some time.
