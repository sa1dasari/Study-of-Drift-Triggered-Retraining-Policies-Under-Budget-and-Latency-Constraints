# Study-of-Drift-Triggered-Retraining-Policies-Under-Budget-and-Latency-Constraints
## Overview
This repository contains a reproducible empirical systems study comparing three model retraining policies (periodic, error-threshold, drift-triggered) for streaming ML systems under concept drift, budget constraints, and deployment latency.
## Core Research Question: 
How do different model refresh policies (periodic, error-threshold, drift-triggered) trade off accuracy, cost, and latency under concept drift?
